This example shows 32 various graphical shapes moving on screen without
flickering or screen tearing. You can create a file cmdline.txt like this on the
SD(HC) card to change the frame buffer size:

width=640 height=480

This example can be used on a ST7789- or ILI9314-based SPI display or on
a SSD1306-based I2C display too. For it you have to update the configuration for
your display in the file addon/display/displayconfig.h and must enable one (!)
of the following definitions in the Makefile before build:

SPI_DISPLAY = DISPLAY_TYPE_ST7789
SPI_DISPLAY = DISPLAY_TYPE_ILI9341
I2C_DISPLAY = DISPLAY_TYPE_SSD1306

You also have to build the library in addon/display/ before build.
