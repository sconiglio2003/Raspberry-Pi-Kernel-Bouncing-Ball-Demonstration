# Raspberry-Pi-Kernel-Bouncing-Ball-Demonstration
This project is what I use to ensure my toolchain is set up properly. The project is known to work. If I ever have questions of whether or not the circle project make settings are configured correctly, I just build this bouncing ball demo. If it works, then my toolchains and other configurations are working just fine. Works on an HDMI display.
